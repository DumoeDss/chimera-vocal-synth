//! Singing: syllables on notes, through the same gestural planner as speech.
//!  - A note's vowel lands on the beat. Its onset consonants are sung just before it (they take
//!    their time from the previous note, as singers do), its coda just before the next onset.
//!  - Diphthongs sustain their first vowel and glide to the second at the end of the note. A rising
//!    one's medial glide is sung with the onset, so the main vowel holds from the beat.
//!  - A closing rhyme (`Syllable::closing`, Mandarin's) ends in one movement: its off-glide or its
//!    nasal coda is where the vowel ends up at the end of the note, not a part held after it.
//!  - A melisma ("-") carries the vowel onto further notes; the coda waits for the last of them.
//!  - Vibrato blooms a quarter of a second into a held vowel.
//!
//! Live playing uses open-ended notes: a key press sings the onset and starts a vowel that lasts
//! until the key is released (tagged gestures, ended with GestureScore.release), and the release
//! sings the glide and the coda.
//!
//! These planners allocate (they run off the audio thread).
